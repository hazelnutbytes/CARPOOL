//  This file is FROZEN. It is the single source of truth for all data shapes.
//  - Do NOT redefine, rename, or restructure any struct here.
//  - Do NOT add or remove fields unless the human explicitly asks.
//  - Every module #includes this. If you invent a different Driver/Customer
//    shape in your module, the project will NOT compile. Use these exactly.
//  - When generating a module, treat these structs as already-existing types
//    you can read and write -- do not recreate them in your own file.
